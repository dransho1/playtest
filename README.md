This should be fun :]


Updated 12/2020. Will need to redo as API changed a lot. https://github.com/plamere/spotipy

P0 idea: return the most hip songs that someone has the last few weeks (50 songs apparant max). Scored by popularity.
    - Easier than queue
    - Focus on building web app and spotify stuff a bit less so
